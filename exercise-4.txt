Exercise 4

List all of the first names for AddressBook.name="Pharetra Ut Limited"
The first and last letters should be capitalized

1. select * from AddressBook where name = 'Pharetra Ut Limited';
2. select concat(substring(firstName, 1, length(firstName)-1),upper(substring(firstName, -1))) as `concatenated` from Entry where addressBookId = '10';

..later realized I can do: select concat(substring(firstName, 1, length(firstName)-1),upper(substring(firstName, -1))) as `concatenated` from Entry join AddressBook on (Entry.addressBookId=AddressBook.id) where AddressBook.name="Pharetra Ut Limited";
'join' would allow me to use just one query. not the way I first thought of it, but pretty cool!
